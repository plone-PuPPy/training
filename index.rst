Welcome, PuPPy Friends!
=======================

If you want to skip this introduction, go ahead and jump right into the installation,
which you can find in the table of contents under :ref:`3. Installing Plone for the Training <instructions-label>`.
When you are done, come back and fill out your :ref:`puppy_contributor_agreement`.


.. _puppy_installation:

Installation
------------

Your fellow PuPPy-Plonistas have built this set of installation instructions
to simplify the setup of a Plone development environment on your machine.
We want to spend as little time as possible installing Plone
and troubleshooting individual installations,
and maximize the amount of fun to be had hacking Plone code.
This is a fork of the official documentation for the open source
`"Mastering Plone" <http://training.plone.org>`_
training, and lives at https://github.com/plone-PuPPy/training.
(This explains all the references to "training", in case you were wondering.)
The main difference between our fork and the original is that
in the normal training a recent stable release of Plone is used.
However, for our purposes, we want to be on the bleeding edge,
and so we are using the so-called
"`buildout.coredev <https://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev>`_".


Mastering Plone is intended as a week-long training
for people who are new to Plone
or want to learn about the current best practices of Plone development.
There are many, many chapters in this training,
but you will only need to read and follow chapter
:ref:`3. Installing Plone for the Training <instructions-label>`.
Please set aside some time during the week before our hackathon
to perform the installation.
Once you have installed VirtualBox and Vagrant,
you should expect the process to take roughly one hour
on a fast internet connection.
Finally, do let us know if you run into any trouble
by filing an issue on the
`github project page <https://github.com/plone-PuPPy/training/issues>`_.


.. _puppy_contributor_agreement:

Contributor Agreement
---------------------

Before coming to hack-night,
please sign the contributor agreement at
http://plone.org/foundation/contributors-agreement/agreement.pdf/at_download/file,
then scan and email it to assignments@plone.org.
In your email please tell us your GitHub username and mention that you are a member of PuPPy,
so that we will be notified when your contributor agreement was accepted.
This offers both copyright protection and ensures that the Plone Foundation is able to exercise some control over the codebase,
ensuring it is not appropriated for someone's unethical purposes.
For questions about why the agreement is required,
please see `Contributorâ€™s Agreement for Plone Explained <https://buildoutcoredev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributors_agreement_explained.html>`_.


Thank you, and we hope you have fun!
